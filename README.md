Welcome! Star-course.com used to be a simple tumblr page, but I had some time on my hands and decided to turn it into a static site with a lot more customizability. If you're familiar with HTML, excellent. Otherwise, you're about to be. If you've never dabbled with HTML before, I recommend reading a few short tutorials before proceeding.

It's very straightforward. The only changes you'll likely need to make are those to the 'contact' section and updates to the CTA banner (call-to-action) at the top of the page.

### Editing:
 - The way it's currently set up is as a Github page, meaning the DNS is pointing at Github and the site is exactly what's in this repository.

 - It's bad practice to edit on the site, but it's possible. You can click on `index.html` and there is an `Edit` button in the upper right corner. When you are finished making changes, clicking `Save` will commit them to the repository and push them automatically. Meaning whatever you save will go directly to the site, so be careful.

 - #####What I recommend if you are not tech-y:
   - Click `Download ZIP` on the right and extract it to a folder somewhere.
   - Open `index.html` in a text editor (I recommend Sublime) and also open it in your browser. Refresh the page after making any changes, and voila! Local development.
   - When you are done, you can either redo these changes in the online editor, or copy+paste the file into the file via the editor.


 - If you have experience with git (or want to have some), awesome. There are quick tutorials out there, and it's a lot better for avoiding mistakes and tracking history.

### Adding new content:
 - If you need to add a poster/change a background image, `upload to github..?`

### Deployment:
 - The nice thing about using Github pages is that the code on the site is almost immediately updated as changes are pushed to the repository. So if you're editing on the site, give it a few seconds and they should be visible. (you should be editing locally, though.)

```

That should cover everything. If use Github the right way, I'll shed a tear of happiness. But that isn't specifically required for the position, so don't fret.

### Good luck! We're all counting on you.

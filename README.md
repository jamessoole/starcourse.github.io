Welcome! Star-course.com used to be a simple tumblr page, but I had some time on my hands and decided to turn it into a static site with a lot more customizability. If you're familiar with HTML, excellent. Otherwise, you're about to be. If you've never dabbled with HTML before, I recommend reading a few short tutorials before proceeding.

It's very straightforward. The only changes you'll likely need to make are those to the 'contact' section and updates to the CTA banner (call-to-action) at the top of the page.

### Making changes:
 - Click `Clone in desktop` on the right. It may ask to install the Github app - you should do that.
 - Open `index.html` in a text editor (I recommend Sublime) and also open it in your browser. Refresh the page after making any changes, and voila! Local development.
 - When you are done, you can open the Github app and use it to `commit` and `push` changes. Their tutorials would do a better job than me, but you should be able to figure it out quickly.

### Adding new content:
 - If you need to add a poster/change a background image, be sure to add it to the proper folder and have Git recognize it.

### Deployment:
 - The nice thing about using Github pages is that the code on the site is almost immediately updated as changes are pushed to the repository. So once you push, it's live within seconds.
 - BECAUSE OF THIS, YOU SHOULD ONLY MAKE CHANGES LOCALLY!
 - Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in your terminal from this project's main folder and open a browser to `localhost:8000` or whatever it tells you it's running on. There you can see changes immediately and be sure it won't break the site.

That should cover everything. If this made sense, I'll shed a tear of happiness. But if you have any questions, shoot me a message or an [email](mailto:combatfetus4@gmail.com).

### Good luck! We're all counting on you.
